# Welcome! I'm Max DeLong

I love the outdoors and tech. You'll often find me hiking, biking, or lifting in my free time. And when I'm inside, I'm probably playing (winning) [Dota 2](https://www.dota2.com/home) or training my German shepherd dog Gwyn.

## About Me

On the professional side, I enjoy programming and architecting automated workflows that incorporate machine learning. Hooking up various services together and transforming raw data into a usable/actionable insight always gets me into a flow state.

Since June 2022, I've been working at Nationwide, where I've primarily created and maintain machine learning workflows using Databricks and AWS.

## Education

I graduated from the Ohio State University with a degree in Economics, specializing in econometric methods. Been studying machine learning and statistics at scale since.

## Personal Projects and Contributions

Currently focusing on building out various different machine learning projects using AWS and Kubeflow to automate the workloads - putting the output onto my [GitHub pages site](https://maxdelong.github.io/maxdelong-mainsite/) for everyone to see! 

Also, I'm learning how to contribute to open source projects like [Apache Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark), [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow), [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), and [Veloren](https://github.com/veloren/veloren). I believe that open source projects are key to a better and more stable tech future.

Feel free to browse through my repositories and check out the cool stuff I've been up to. And if you're interested in collaborating or have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.
