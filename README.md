# Welcome! I'm Max DeLong

I love the outdoors and tech. You'll often find me hiking, biking, or swimming in my free time. And when I'm inside, I'm probably playing (winning) [Dota 2](https://www.dota2.com/home) or training my German shepherd dog Gwyn.

## About Me

On the professional side, I enjoy programming and architecting automated workflows that incorporate machine learning. Hooking up various services together and transforming raw data into a usable/actionable insight always gets me into a flow state.

Since June 2022, I've been fortunate enough to work at Nationwide, where I've had the opportunity to work on many machine learning projects with a wide range of business partners within personal lines. My focus has been on implementing automated workflows and integrating machine learning models into different systems using Databricks, AWS, and many other services.

## Education

I graduated from the Ohio State University with a degree in Economics, specializing in econometric methods. What this means is that I love analyzing data, finding patterns, and making sense of complex trends.

## Personal Projects and Contributions

Currently focusing on building out various different machine learning projects using AWS services to automate the workloads - putting the output onto my GitHub pages site for everyone to see! 

Also, I'm learning how to contribute to open source projects like [Apache Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark), [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow), [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), and [Veloren](https://github.com/veloren/veloren)

Feel free to browse through my repositories and check out the cool stuff I've been up to. And if you're interested in collaborating or have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.
