# Welcome! I'm Max DeLong

I love the outdoors and tech. You'll often find me hiking, biking, or lifting in my free time. And when I'm inside, I'm probably playing [Dota 2](https://www.dota2.com/home) or BTD6, training my German shepherd dog Gwyn, or programming whether that be contributing to open source or building out my own projects.

## About Me

On the professional side, I enjoy programming systems and maintaining cloud platforms. Hooking up various distributed services together with extensive observability and deployment automation has been a big focus of mine.


## Education

I graduated from the Ohio State University with a degree in both Applied Economics and Chinese. 

## Personal Projects and Contributions

Currently focusing on building out various experiments and finding what I like.

Currently contributing to [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus), [polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars), [delta-rs](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs), and [delta-kernel-rs](https://github.com/delta-incubator/delta-kernel-rs). I believe that open source projects are the key to a better future and less reliance on any individual company.

Feel free to browse through my repositories and check out the cool stuff I've been up to. And if you're interested in collaborating or have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.
