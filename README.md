# Welcome! I'm Max DeLong

I love the outdoors and tech. You'll often find me hiking or just being outside in my free time. When I'm inside, I'm probably playing [Dota 2](https://www.dota2.com/home) or BTD6, training my German shepherd dog Gwyn, or programming whether that be contributing to open source or building out my own projects.

## About Me

On the professional side, I enjoy working on the backend systems of complex multi-year large scale projects. Hooking up various services together with observability and CI/CD automation has been a big focus of mine. If a deployment isn't as simple as running a pipeline and watching it go through dev, test, and then prod, it isn't simple enough yet. If it can't be rolled back just as easy, it isn't safe yet. 


## Education

I graduated from the Ohio State University with a degree in both Applied Economics and Chinese. 

## Personal Projects and Contributions

Currently focusing on building out various experiments and finding what I like. 

Currently contributing to [polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars), [delta-rs](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs), and [delta-kernel-rs](https://github.com/delta-incubator/delta-kernel-rs). I believe that open source projects are the key to a better future and less reliance on any individual company.

Feel free to browse through my repositories and check out the cool stuff I've been up to. And if you're interested in collaborating or have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.
